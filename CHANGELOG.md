## [v1.0.7] - 2025-08-21

### Added
- Doctest-style Examples across the public API surface of JavaAnalysis, PythonAnalysis, CAnalysis, and core CLDK helpers. Coverage includes Java CRUD operations and comment/docstring query APIs, plus concise inline examples for Python and C where applicable.
- Examples documenting expected NotImplementedError behavior for placeholder APIs (PythonAnalysis and CAnalysis) using doctest flags.

### Changed
- Converted and standardized docstrings to strict Google style (Args, Returns, Raises, Examples) across edited modules.
- Standardized Examples to use the CLDK facade (e.g., `CLDK(language="java").analysis(...)`) instead of raw constructor calls.
- Normalized all doctest Example inputs to single-line strings to ensure reliable mkdocstrings rendering.
- Clarified `CLDK.analysis` return type with a precise union: `JavaAnalysis | PythonAnalysis | CAnalysis`.

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md logo display on PyPI by updating image URLs to use raw GitHub URLs and maintaining theme-based auto-switching with proper fallback
- mkdocstrings rendering issues caused by multi-line doctest strings and formatting inconsistencies.
- Replaced confusing examples like `JavaAnalysis(None, None, ...)` with clear CLDK-based initialization patterns.
- Packaging: ensured the built wheel includes the `cldk` package by adding `packages = [{ include = "cldk" }]` to Poetry configuration.

### Removed
- Multi-line doctest strings in Examples that broke mkdocstrings rendering; all examples are now single-line.

## [v1.0.6] - 2025-07-23

### Added
- Added `argument_expr` field to JCallSite model for capturing actual parameter expressions in method calls

### Changed
- Updated codeanalyzer jar to version 2.3.5 with support for call argument expressions and fully qualified parameter types

- Updated method signature format to use fully qualified type names (e.g., `java.lang.String` instead of `String`)
- Updated test fixtures with new analysis.json data reflecting the signature format changes

### Fixed
- Fixed method signature handling to maintain fully qualified parameter types for better type resolution
- Updated test cases to use fully qualified method signatures for improved accuracy
